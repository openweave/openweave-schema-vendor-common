/**
 * Liveness trait
 * Expresses the liveness of the connectivity of a device relative to another device or service
 * In most cases the connectivity status is based on the mutual subscription message traffic
 * however it can also be based on a uni-directional heartbeat message.
 * When based on a mutual subscription just Liveness is used.  When based on a uni-directional
 * heartbeat message LowPowerHeartbeatSettings define the controlling parameters for that message
 * Liveness is always published by the observer using the resource ID of the device being observed
 *
 * Properties:
 *     status
 *     time_status_changed
 *     max_inactivity_duration
 *
 * The properties express current connectivity, last time the connectivity changed and the amount
 * of time that must elapse without valid messages to consider the device offline.
 *
 *     status                   Represents the current status of the liveness of the device being
 *                              monitored.  In most cases this will just represent the ONLINE /
 *                              UNREACHABLE states, however it could be implemented in the trait
 *                              handler to have a subscription on another device's status properties
 *                              that could be republished here.
 *     time_status_changed      This value represents the last time the device status was changed.
 *                              It will be updated whenever the status is changed.
 *     max_inactivity_duration  This value represents how much time must pass before the device
 *                              is considered offline. The device will be considered offline if
 *                              none of the following messages are received within this time:
 *                                  - When using a mutual subscription
 *                                      Any WDM message with the Subscription ID established when
 *                                      the mutual subscription was created
 *                                  - When using the low power heartbeat profile
 *                                      Any heartbeat message
